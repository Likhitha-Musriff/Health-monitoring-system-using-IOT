# Health Monitoring System using IoT

This project involves a system that continuously monitors various vital signs of a patient, including heart rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. The data is collected using IoT devices like sensors (heart rate monitor, temperature sensor, etc.), and then transmitted wirelessly to a cloud platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Components:
1. **IoT Devices:** Sensors to collect real-time data (heart rate, temperature, oxygen, blood pressure).
2. **Wireless Communication:** Data transmission via WiFi or Bluetooth.
3. **Cloud Integration:** Data storage and real-time monitoring using a cloud platform.

## Requirements:
- Arduino / Raspberry Pi for sensor integration
- Python for data analysis
- Cloud API for storing and visualizing data

## Instructions:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Upload the Arduino code or run Raspberry Pi code for sensor data collection.
3. Use the cloud integration code to send data to the cloud platform.
